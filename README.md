# Mario-Kart
This was a high-intensity Java project focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) I did my sophmore year, graphical rendering, and real-time event handling. Despite being one of the most challenging assignments in the curriculum, I successfully moved this from a broken state to a fully functional game.

🛠️ Technical Challenges Overcome
Collision Detection: Implemented logic to handle interaction between the player sprite and environment boundaries.

Event Handling: Managed real-time keyboard inputs to control kart movement and velocity.

Persistence: While others abandoned this project due to its complexity, I leveraged technical resources and peer-mentorship to troubleshoot the code until the game loop was stable and playable.

📈 Key Learnings
This project taught me the importance of system robustness. In engineering, "it works" is the baseline, and the grit required to reach that baseline when others quit is what defines my approach to software development.
